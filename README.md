# Aerial Diffusion Reimplementation
 Repository to store the code for the Aerial Diffusion Reimplementation. Final project of the Computer Vision class at Sapienza Universit√† di Roma for the Artificial Intelligence and Robotics course accademic year 2023/2024. Aim of the project is to re-implement the 'Aerial Diffusion: Text Guided Ground-to-Aerial View Translation from a Single Image using Diffusion Model' paper found at the link: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11444.

## The Dataset
 For the dataset we originally thought about downloading images from the web and automatically annotate them, however image captioning is a task in itself that we decided was not relevant to the re-implementation thus we downloaded the Flickr 8K dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityajn105/flickr8k?resource=download). The chosen dataset contains 8000 images and a captions.txt file that contains 5 human-generated captions per image. An extract from the images and captions is below: ![Example of images](./figs/Examples.png)

## Files
 The util.py file contains utility code like the matching function for images and captions.
